# Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now

  * Knowing that what is cannot be undone---because it already is --- you say yes to what is or accept what isn't.
  * Of course, it  is not really the limit-situation that makes room for the miracle of grace and redemption, but the act of surrender. 
So whenever any kind of disaster strikes, or something goes seriously "wrong" --- illness, disability, loss of home or fortune or of a socially defined identity, breakup of a close relationship, death or suffering of a loved one, or your own impending death --- know that there is another side to it, that you are just one step away from something incredible: a complete alchemical transmutation of the base metal of pain and suffering into gold. That one step is called surrender.
