# Sequence Models
a 3-week online course by Andrew Ng, Nov 2020
---

## Week 1: Recurrent Neural Networks
   * Why sequence models
     * c.f. sequential data natively with feedforward network
   * Recurrent Neural Network Model
   * Backpropagation through time
   * Different types of RNNs
     * Many-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-many, one-to-one
     * Many-to-many with Tx = Ty and Many-to-many with Tx $\neq$ Ty
   * Language model and sequence generation
   * Sampling novel sequences
   * Vanishing gradients with RNNs
   * Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
   * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   * Bi-directional RNN
   * Deep RNNs
## Week 2: Natural Language Processing & Word Embeddings

## Week 3: Sequence models & Attention mechanism
