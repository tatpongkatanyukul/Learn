## Have learned
* Covid vaccines: mRNA, viral vector (DNA), and convention (dead or attenuated virus)
* Virus: some are inert other cell. Some can have basic movement. Some virus is taken inside a cell by interaction with the cell receptor and cell takes them in. Virus needs host cells for replication. They do not have mechanism of their own.
* Antenna: Electric field is more related to voltage than current (i.e., there can be E field without current)
  * while magnetic field can be caused by both DC current and chanage in electric field, only change in magnetic field can cause the electric field.
  * Static magnetic field cannot cause electric field. But, if there is current, there will be a magnetic field.
  * Therefore, RF wave can be broadcasted from an antenna with open circut (no current flowing, i.e., electric field alone can cause a magnetic field, then change in B will cause E and so on)

## Mysteries
  * Quantum
    * Clear: superposition (MIT course, Allan Adams) and entanglement (Quantum for Everyone, Bell's inequality Experiments); how to single out a photon; how to get entangled particles (I get it in some degree)
    * Still mystery: how these properties (superposition and entanglement) can be exploited for quantum computing
      * continue and finish up [Quantum Mechanics for Everyone](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/Learn/blob/main/QuantumMech.md)
    
  * Cell differentiation/Genetics
    * Clear: DNA has all information about genes (more than 20,000 genes) and histones play a role of expressing each genes. DNA is a recipe to make protein and protein is a machine for biological physicality.
    * Still mysteries:
      * (1) How do liver cells know that they have to produce cholesterrol and other stuffs, but skin cells do not? 
      * (2) How do cells at our finger tips know they need to stop other we keep having too long finger?
      * (3) How can we influence the mutation? If ancestor hoppers stare at leaves often enough, do that cause the mutation so that their descendants really look similar to leaves?
      * Perhaps, genetics or cell differentiation course

  * Antenna
    * Clear: we do not have to have a current flowing through to have an antenna radiate. (We just need an electric field.)
      * 
    * Still mystery: they talk about standing wave voltage at different point about a transmission line. I cannot put unify this with the circuit theory and wonder if it is a real physical thing or if it is just a convenient perception.   
      * It is a physical  thing. See [Applied Electromagnetic Field Theory](https://scholar.valpo.edu/engineering_oer/1/) by Doug Tougaw (and video lecture 30: [Applied Electromagnetic Field Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1A74NCuF-g)) 
      * The explanation is that 
        * (1) the voltage source has to AC 
        * (2) when it switches polarity, it forces charges to move
        * (3) the wire is not infinitestimally small 

## Not a complete mystery, but I have no clue
  * How to solve Maxwell equations
  * How to use (even a simplified version of) the Navier-Stokes
