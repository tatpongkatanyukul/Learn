Mihaly Csikszentmihaly: Flow (~ enjoy doing)

Some features of flow
  * challenging but attainable goals
  * strong focused concentration
  * the activity is intrinsically rewarding
  * feelings of serenity
  * loss of self-consciousness
  * timelessness / lose track of time passing
  * lack of awareness of physical needs
  * **complete focus on the activity itself**
  
Flow = matching of fully applying skills to the matchingly high challenges
  
Extrinsic motivation = engaging in a behavior in order to earn external rewards or avoid punishments
  
Intrinsic motivation = engaging in a behavior because you enjoy the activity itself

Deci 1971: Extrinsic motivation may undermine intrinsic motivation.
--> A focus on grades can undermine instrinsic motivation and a growth mindset.

Growth mindset
   * The belief that intelligence can be trained.
   
Fixed mindset
   * The belieft that basic qualities like intelligence and talent are fixed.
   
--> Growth mindset can be trained.   

Otake et al. (2006): kindness correlates to happiness
Lyubomirksy et al. (2005): random act of kindness

Better way of wanting
* wanting the right parts of what we already want
 * E.g., a "good" job: 2 factors
   * Job that activates or allow you to use your signature strengths
   * Job that increases flow
 * E.g., a "good" grade
   * Learn the lessons
   * Have a growth mindset
* wanting better stuff that you don't want yet
   * chance to do the act of **kindness**
