## Have learned
* Covid vaccines: mRNA, viral vector (DNA), and convention (dead or attenuated virus)
  * mRNA is to produce a signature of a target virus, e.g., COVID19 spikes. It only needs to get inside the cell. It may use nanoparticle as its carrier. mRNA is not very stable that is why is needed to keep under very low temperature. Our own cell produces the virus signatures so that our immune system can be trained on.
  * viral vector, e.g., a shell of adeno virus, is changed its payload to DNA (also of a signature of a target virus). It needs to get DNA inside the cell and inside the nucleus.
* Virus: some are inert other cell. Some can have basic movement. Some virus is taken inside a cell by interaction with the cell receptor and cell takes them in. Virus needs host cells for replication. They do not have mechanism of their own.
* Antenna: Electric field is more related to voltage than current (i.e., there can be E field without current)
  * while magnetic field can be caused by both DC current and chanage in electric field, only change in magnetic field can cause the electric field.
  * Static magnetic field cannot cause electric field. But, if there is current, there will be a magnetic field.
  * Therefore, RF wave can be broadcasted from an antenna with open circut (no current flowing, i.e., electric field alone can cause a magnetic field, then change in B will cause E and so on)
  * Faraday's and Lenz's equation: v(t) = - d \phi/ d t. The minus sign is from Lenz: the direction of the (emf) voltage has to produce a current opposing a change in magnetic flux. (Solve the mystery of "discrepancy" between LCA and Physics)
  * Load and No-Load Operation of a [Transformer](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/Learn/blob/main/transformer.md)
    * [EzEd's Single Phase Transformer Part I - Construction & Working - No-Load & On-Load](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai3eriqcSYc)

## Mysteries
  * Quantum
    * Clear: superposition (MIT course, Allan Adams) and entanglement (Quantum for Everyone, Bell's inequality Experiments); how to single out a photon; how to get entangled particles (I get it in some degree)
    * Still mystery: how these properties (superposition and entanglement) can be exploited for quantum computing
      * continue and finish up [Quantum Mechanics for Everyone](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/Learn/blob/main/QuantumMech.md)
    
  * Cell differentiation/Genetics
    * Clear: DNA has all information about genes (more than 20,000 genes) and histones play a role of expressing each genes. DNA is a recipe to make protein and protein is a machine for biological physicality.
    * Still mysteries:
      * (1) How do liver cells know that they have to produce cholesterrol and other stuffs, but skin cells do not? 
      * (2) How do cells at our finger tips know they need to stop other we keep having too long finger?
      * (3) How can we influence the mutation? If ancestor hoppers stare at leaves often enough, do that cause the mutation so that their descendants really look similar to leaves?
      * Perhaps, genetics or cell differentiation course

  * Antenna
    * Clear: we do not have to have a current flowing through to have an antenna radiate. (We just need an electric field.)
      * see Maxwell's equations (esp., the 4th one): curl B depends on both current and change in electric field.
        * But, curl E depends only on negative change in magnetic field. (the 3rd eq.)  
    * Mystery solved!!!: they talk about standing wave voltage at different point about a transmission line. I cannot put unify this with the circuit theory and wonder if it is a real physical thing or if it is just a convenient perception.   
      * It is a physical  thing. See [Applied Electromagnetic Field Theory](https://scholar.valpo.edu/engineering_oer/1/) by Doug Tougaw (and video lecture 30: [Applied Electromagnetic Field Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1A74NCuF-g)) (Tougaw, Doug, "Applied Electromagnetic Field Theory" (2018). Engineering Curricular Materials. 1. https://scholar.valpo.edu/engineering_oer/1) 
      * The explanation is that 
        * (1) the voltage source has to AC 
        * (2) when it switches polarity, it forces charges to move (when charges moves, there is a current!)
        * (3) the wire is not infinitestimally small 

## Not a complete mystery, but I have no clue
  * How to solve Maxwell equations
  * How to use (even a simplified version of) the Navier-Stokes
