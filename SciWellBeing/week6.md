    * Wansink et al. 2016: what visible on counter affects your weight.
    1. Fix bad habits, e.g., put your phone away; cut down social media; have less cue for wrong stuffs
    2. Promote healthy environments, e.g., gratitude journal, meditation note, have a supporting group
  * Goal Setting
    1. Goal specificity = the degree of quantitative precision with which a goal is specified. E.g., when you are going to meditate and for how long
    2. Goal visualization = thinking about your goal
      * mental contrasting = a visualization technique involving first thinking of positive future outcome followed by thinking of obstacles.
    3. Goal planning
      * Implementation intention = a self-regulatory strategy in the form of an "if-then" plan that can lead to better goal attainment. E.g., if I see free cookies, I'll walk away.
