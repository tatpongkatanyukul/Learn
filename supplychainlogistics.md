## Week 1 Read: comparison-of-transportation-modes

### Speed
Truck: approximately 50 miles (or 80 kilometers) per hour over the highway for up to 500 miles (800 kilometers)

Train: approximately 30 miles (or 50 kilometers) per hour over almost any distance.

Air: upwards of 200 miles (or 320 kilometers) per hour for distances of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers), including ground operations.

### Distance
Truck: up to 500 miles (800 kilometers) is the ideal distance, but there are still advantages over the other modes up to 750 miles (1200 kilometers).

Train: for distances of more than 750 miles intermodal has some speed advantages, but the average distance for intermodal is somewhere around 1,700 miles.

Air: at least 500 miles (800 kilometers) but typically more than 2000 miles.

### Cost
Truck: current rates are highly variable, but $1.50 per mile is a reasonable starting value for a TL shipment

Rail: intermodal freight shipments are typically much cheaper than TL and a common rule of thumb is about 60-80% of the price of a TL shipment.

Air: typically we consider air freight to be about 6 to 8 times more expensive than truck.
