### file tags

The underlying motives are:
  * for building a searchable repository of programming problems

Examples, from MS Advanced Query Syntax, 
  * ```tags: (started AND python)``` for files having both tags "started" and "python"
  * ```tags: (started OR expression OR assignment)``` for files having tags "started", "expression" or "assignment"
