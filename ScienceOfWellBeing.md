# The Science of Well-Being
a 10-week course by Laurie Santos, Yale University, started Nov 2nd, 2020

---

What psychological science says about the good life?
   * Misconceptions about happiness
   * Why our expections are so bad?
     * hedonic adaptation
     * anchor on a reference point
     * strongest intuitions are often totally wrong
   * How can we overcome our biases?
   * Stuf that really makes us happy
   * Putting strategies into practice
   
   * Why our expections are so bad?
     * biases in our mind, hedonic adaptation
   
   Strategies
   * 1. Thwart your hedonic adaptation
   * 2. Reset your reference points
   
   Character strengths are:
     * Ubiquitous
     * Fulfilling
     * Morally-valued
     * Not able to deminish others
     * The opposite of a negative trait
     * Trait-like (stable individual difference)
     * Distinctive
     * Paragons (some people really have it)
       * Prodigies 
     * Selective absence (some people don't have it)
     
Character strengths:
   * appreciation of beauty, kindness, bravery, leadership, citizenship, love, 
   * creativity, love of learning, curiosity, modesty and humility,
   * fairness, persistence, forgiveness and mercy, perspective, gratitude, prudence, hope, self-regulation,
   * humor, social intelligence, integrity, spirituality, judgement, zest
       
> Seligman et al. 2005: "Use one of your top strengths in a new and different way everyday for one week."

> Harzer & Ruch 2012: "What makes people think of their job as "a calling"?
Tested the # of signature strengths they use throughout the day
--> Use multple of your signature strengths makes it a calling.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly: Flow (~ enjoy doing)

Some features of flow
  * challenging but attainable goals
  * strong focused concentration
  * the activity is intrinsically rewarding
  * feelings of serenity
  * loss of self-consciousness
  * timelessness / lose track of time passing
  * lack of awareness of physical needs
  * **complete focus on the activity itself**
  
Flow = matching of fully applying skills to the matchingly high challenges
  
Extrinsic motivation = engaging in a behavior in order to earn external rewards or avoid punishments
  
Intrinsic motivation = engaging in a behavior because you enjoy the activity itself

Deci 1971: Extrinsic motivation may undermine intrinsic motivation.
--> A focus on grades can undermine instrinsic motivation and a growth mindset.

Growth mindset
   * The belief that intelligence can be trained.
   
Fixed mindset
   * The belieft that basic qualities like intelligence and talent are fixed.
   
--> Growth mindset can be trained.   

Otake et al. (2006): kindness correlates to happiness
Lyubomirksy et al. (2005): random act of kindness
> Dunn et al. (2008): found that spending money on other people made their subjects happier than spending on themselves. 
> They also found that the amount of money they spent on others didn't affect the outcome; 
> the people who spent $5 on someone else were just as happy as the people who spent $20 on someone else.

> Our minds wanders 46.9% of the time! (Killingsworth & Gilbert 2010)
default network = a network of interacting brain regions known to activate "by default" when a person is not involved in the task.
  * Default Mode Network (DMN) comes on within a fraction of a second after task.
  * DMN thinks outside the here & now: past, future, others (e.g., fantasy, what others think)
  * mind wandering is likely to lead to unpleasant feeling.
     * meditation helps curbing out mind wandering.
     
Hedy Kober: Brewer et al. 2011
  * meditation exprts vs controls
  * shut off the DMN (during and after the med session)
  * more connection on other parts
  
Hoelzel et al.2011  study gray matter size before/after 8-week mindfulness-basedstress reduction course
average 27 min/day ---> increase the gray matter size
Mrakek et al. (2013): meditation boosts in cognitive performance.

Hutcherson et al. 2008: loving-kindness meditation increases social connection.


Babyak et al. 2000: 156 people suffering from major depression: exercise is better than taking anti-depressant
Hillman et al. 2008: exercise helps cognitive outcomes

Dingses et al. 1997: normal sleep (7.4 hr) vs deprived sleep (4.98 hr)
* normal sleep has better mood and **less complaints**.

Walker et al. 2002: sleep helps cognitive performance.
* taking nap during the day helps cognitive performance

**Wagner et al. 2004**: (cool!) test if subjects figure out the secret rules (insight).

Chronic times having less than 5 hours or less of sleep, you are:
  * increase risk of death
  * decrease sperm count
  * increase risk of heart disease
  * increase risk of diabetes
  * increase risk of some cancers
  * increase risk of obesity
  * quadruple stroke risk

## Better way of wanting
* wanting the right parts of what we already want
 * E.g., a "good" job: 2 factors
   * Job that activates or allow you to use your signature strengths
   * Job that increases flow
 * E.g., a "good" grade
   * Learn the lessons
   * Have a growth mindset
* wanting better stuff that you don't want yet
   * chance to do the act of **kindness**
   * social connection
   * time affluent: having time to the things that we enjoy
   * mind control: control our own mind (not all over the place/mind wandering)
      * meditation (also has other benefits)
   * healthy practices
      * exercise
      * sleep
