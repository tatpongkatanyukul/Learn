* Covid vaccines: mRNA, viral vector (DNA), and convention (dead or attenuated virus)
  * mRNA is to produce a signature of a target virus, e.g., COVID19 spikes. It only needs to get inside the cell. It may use nanoparticle as its carrier. mRNA is not very stable that is why is needed to keep under very low temperature. Our own cell produces the virus signatures so that our immune system can be trained on.
  * viral vector, e.g., a shell of adeno virus, is changed its payload to DNA (also of a signature of a target virus). It needs to get DNA inside the cell and inside the nucleus.
* Virus: some are inert other cell. Some can have basic movement. Some virus is taken inside a cell by interaction with the cell receptor and cell takes them in. Virus needs host cells for replication. They do not have mechanism of their own.
* Antenna: Electric field is more related to voltage than current (i.e., there can be E field without current)
  * while magnetic field can be caused by both DC current and chanage in electric field, only change in magnetic field can cause the electric field.
  * Static magnetic field cannot cause electric field. But, if there is current, there will be a magnetic field.
  * Therefore, RF wave can be broadcasted from an antenna with open circut (no current flowing, i.e., electric field alone can cause a magnetic field, then change in B will cause E and so on)
  * Faraday's and Lenz's equation: v(t) = - d \phi/ d t. The minus sign is from Lenz: the direction of the (emf) voltage has to produce a current opposing a change in magnetic flux. (Solve the mystery of "discrepancy" between LCA and Physics)
