# Radioactive substance and geiger counter

got curious after listening to Suzanne Simard's TED: Tree Talk, which she told her story how she learned tree communication.


## What makes substance radioactive?

> Radioactivity is the random spontaneous disintegration of an atom of an element. The stability of the nucleus depends on the relative numbers of protons and neutrons present. The most stable nuclides tend to have an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons as each group of two protons and two neutrons, in the nucleus, makes an especially stable combination. A number of elements have atoms or nuclei which are unstable and consequently split up to form smaller atoms. This is due to all elements wanting to achieve equilibrium or stability in the nucleus.

> A substance is said to be radioactive if it contains unstable nuclei and is able to naturally release energy in the process of shedding high speed charged particles, in an attempt to reach a stable state. With this, a non-radioactive substance will remain intact indefinitely unless acted upon by an external force.

> In the process of transmutation, known as decay, the radioactive nuclei emits charged particles or electromgnetic rays depending on the nature it's instability. This results in a daughter nuclide being produced which may be radioactive or stable, but if it is radioactive it will in turn decay into a daughter nuclide, continuing to do so until it reaches the point of stability, an isotope of lead.

## How a geiger counter works?

> Geiger counter — an instrument that can detect radiation.

> Just to recap, the core of an atom (the nucleus) is surrounded by orbiting electrons, like planets around a sun. The electrons have a negative charge and usually cancel out an equal number of positively charged protons in the nucleus. But if an electron absorbs energy from radiation, it can be pushed out of its orbit. This action is called "ionization" and creates an "ion pair"—a free, negatively charged electron and a positively charged atom.

> Humans cannot detect creation of an ion pair through their five senses. But the Geiger counter is an instrument sensitive enough to detect ionization. Most of us have heard or seen a Geiger counter. They are the least expensive electronic device that can tell you there is radiation around you—though it can't tell you the original source of the radiation, what type it is or how much energy it has.

> How does it work? A Geiger counter has two main parts—a sealed tube, or chamber, filled with gas, and an information display. Radiation enters the tube and when it collides with the gas, it pushes an electron away from the gas atom and creates an ion pair. A wire in the middle of the tube attracts electrons, creating other ion pairs and sending a current through the wire. The current goes to the information display and moves a needle across a scale or makes a number display on a screen. These devices usually provide "counts per minute," or the number of ion pairs created every 60 seconds. If the loud speaker is on, it clicks every time an ion pair is created. The number of clicks indicates how much radiation is entering the Geiger counter chamber

> You hear a clicking sound as soon as you turn on the speaker because there is always some radiation in the background. This radiation comes from the sun, natural uranium in the soil, radon, certain types of rock such as granite, plants and food, even other people and animals.

> The background counts per minute will vary; the needle will move or the number will change even when there is no know radiation source nearby. Many different things cause this fluctuation, including wind, soil moisture, precipitation (rain or snow), temperature, atmospheric conditions, altitude and indoor ventilation. Other factors in readings include geographical location (higher elevations give higher counts), the size and shape of the detector, and how the detector is built (different chamber material and different gases).

> Depending on the elevation and the type of Geiger counter, a typical natural background radiation level is anywhere from five to 60 counts per minute or more. Because background radiation rates vary randomly, you might see that range standing in one spot. It is important to understand that the Geiger counter indicates when an ion pair is created, but nothing about the type of radiation or its energy.
