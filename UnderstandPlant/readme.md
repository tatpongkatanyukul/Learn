# Understand Plants: Part 1

[My questions](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/Learn/blob/main/UnderstandPlant/myplantquestions.md)

## Week 1

### 1.5 Major themes in plant biology

  * Hierarch: organelle (e.g., chloroplast) -> cell -> tissue (e.g., xylem, phloem) -> organ (e.g., leaves) -> organism (e.g., a plant) -> ecosystem (e.g., a forest)
     * A cell is a basic structure.
     * Structure and function are mutually dependent.
     * There is interaction between individual and its environment.
     * Understanding plant biology needs to understand evolution.

### 1.6

  * Discovery science/inductive approach --> see first, hypothesis later
  * Deductive approach --> hypothesis first

### 1.7 The evolution of plant structures

My Recall:
> Prokaryotes are organisms made up of cells that lack a cell nucleus or any membrane-encased organelles. Eukaryotes are organisms made up of cells that possess a membrane-bound nucleus that holds genetic material as well as membrane-bound organelles.
